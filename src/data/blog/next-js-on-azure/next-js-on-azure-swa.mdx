In the second part of this series, we will look at deploying Next-JS to 
Azure Static Web Apps using GitHub Actions and Bicep.

## Source Control Strategy

For the purposes of this article and in general we subscribe to the [Feature-Branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
We only have a single main branch, but develop features in isolation and use the Pull-Request mechanism to 
trigger a review and subsequent merge.

## Workflow Definition in BPMN

To consider our target workflow in abstract, a useful tool is [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org/). Firstly just considering
what happens when a PR is merged into main or a commit is directly pushed (shouldn't happen but does at the start of a project or in emergencies).

### Main Branch Workflow

This is a simplified workflow to demonstrate they key stages involved in a typical CI/CD process applied to a Next-JS build.
In our simple example we have some (very) basic Jest integration tests and PlayWright E2E tests. We want to build test and deploy
to a staging environment where we can perform e2e tests in an environment as similar as possible to production. 
If this succeeds we then push to production.

### PR Workflow

For a PR, we don't want to
